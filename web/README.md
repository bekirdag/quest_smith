An interactive web based version of the Quest Smith system.

Uses the same story files.

To play the game open quest.html from the Pages URL
e.g.
https://bekirdag.github.io/quest_smith/web/quest.html

To use this on a GitHub Repo use the Setup Instructions below.

Setup Instructions:
Goto your GitHub repo settings enable Pages(all)
This turns on a GitHub instance of Pages and does not restrict which files are accessable. This means the story_texts folder and contents are available when the JavaScript tries to load them into the game.
